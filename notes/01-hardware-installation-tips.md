# Hardware Installation Tips

This is not meant to be a guide to build a computer but a few tips I've learned and an overview of why I chose the parts that I did. If you have never built your own PC before, read your motherboard manual from front to back. The manual is a tutorial on how to build a PC specifically made for you! The hardware components that I used in this build may not be available. 

### Before You Touch Anything
- Before purchasing parts, be sure to enter them in a tool like [PC Part Picker](https://pcpartpicker.com/) to make sure that all components are compatible. Use a power supply calculator to ensure power supply wattage is sufficient for your build.
- Never touch components with your computer powered on. If you don't get shocked, you may damage components. Hard disk drives are not meant to be moved while spinning.
- Never touch components without properly grounding yourself. Static electricity may cause damage to components.
- Be gentle with components. If you're forcing something into place, you're doing it wrong. All components click or slide into place with very little force. Tightening screws should be done carefully. This is not a construction project.

### Motherboard
- The motherboard I have selected has built-in CPU and graphics
- Maximum Memory: 16GB
- Hard Drives: 4 x SATA3 6.0 Gb/s connectors
- If you plan on using your computer as a media server with services like Plex or Jellyfin, consider another motherboard which will allow you to install a better CPU and graphics card. If you are not planning on needing video transcoding, this setup works just fine.

### Memory
- I decided on purchasing a single module of 8GB RAM. The motherboard has a maximum of 16GB so I can always buy another one if I need to upgrade.

### Hard Drives
- The Operating System and programs will be stored on the faster Solid State Drive
- Media files and documents will be stored on the 12TB Hard Disk Drive

### Power Supply Unit
- I was going for a budget build, but a power supply unit with a higher efficiency rating may be better for a computer running 24/7.
