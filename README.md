# banaNAS

This is a fun project that I did to learn about Linux, Docker, servers, and networking in general. It is a NAS device running the OpenMediaVault Linux distribution to manage my personal files and programs which I access through VPN. All of the hardware necessary for the build can be purchased for under $400. This repo is where I will share my config files and scripts.

### Why is it called banaNAS? üçåüçåüçå
- My first NAS device was built using a [Banana Pi](https://www.banana-pi.org/en/banana-pi-sbcs/51.html) so I thought it was a cute name that just stuck!
